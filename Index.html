                    <p class="maxWidthFifty marginZero contentRules">Phishing is when victims are deceived into sending information through impersonated services. Phishing scams could be as simple as a text message with a shady link or as intricate as entire social engineering operation in which psychological manipulation is used to siphon sensitive information. There are many types of phishing but all types are based on the fundamental principle of deceiving the victim to think the scam is authentic. A phishing scam can successfully appear authentic through mirroring design principles, spoofing programs (such as phone number spoofing), and social engineering. An example of mirroring design principles is seen in the image to the right. This phishing scam replicates the style of Amazon and has a professional demeanor. There aren't any glaring indicators of a phishing scam. Unless there is an understanding of phishing scams and the said risk, there is no reason to not immediately believe this to be from Amazon themselves. Phishing scams are intricate and ever changing. This website will list the varying types of phishing scams to lower the effectiveness of them. Some insight into phishing scams is all that is needed to prevent them, at least on an individual level </p>

        <div class="row">
            <p class="boxText">Voice phishing (or vishing) is when a phishing scam occurs through a phone call. A voice phishing scam can be standard impersonation, and it mostly is, but technologies are often used to appear authentic. A common voice phishing method is spoofing a phone number. Spoofing a phone number is the act of altering the visible phone number listed through caller ID. Scammers using voice phishing can deliberately change their visible phone number to gain extra trust from potential victims.
